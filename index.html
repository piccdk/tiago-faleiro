            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>My name is Tiago. I am in my late 20s and I’m originally from Lisbon, although I’m currently living in Slovenia. I work for Renaissance Periodization (RP) and I have my own coaching business where I help people with their training and fitness goals.

                <br><br>I’ve always been somewhat of a nerd, so when I started my fitness journey almost 10 years ago, that led me to learn everything I could about it. I was obsessed with it, learning about training and nutrition every single day. I initially started with Youtube videos, but soon started to read books and blogs. Eventually, that progressed to textbooks, scientific articles, and several courses and certifications.  
                
                <br><br>I got particularly interested in exercise and nutritional science and making sure my methods were evidence-based rather than just following traditional unproven practices. Especially since like many others, I ended up following poor advice and making me spin my wheels. 
                
                <br><br>There is nothing more frustrating than putting in hours of work trying to achieve your goal but not making any progress. The more I learned the better I was able to improve my own results. I want to help you avoid misinformation and get to your goal in the most efficient manner possible.

                <h4> WHAT ARE A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS YOU SHOULD
                    KNOW ABOUT MY COACHING SERVICES?</h4>
                <div id="s-text">
                    <h6>YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO WORK HARD</h6>
                        <p>I can help you reach your goals, but you’re the one doing the work. I can not train or diet for you.</p>

                    <h6>RESULTS TAKE TIME</h6>
                    <p>I wish I could say I will get you super big, strong, or lean in a few weeks, but that just doesn’t happen. I don’t promise quick results, and everyone who does is being deceitful. This doesn’t mean you won’t get to your goals, but just be mindful it requires work and time.</p>

                    <h6>I ALWAYS HAVE SUSTAINABILITY IN MIND</h6>
                    <p>I will never compromise long-term results for faster short-term progress.</p>

                    <h6>I’M NOT A MOTIVATIONAL COACH</h6>
                    <p>The best way of thinking about our coach-client relationship is that I’m guiding you, but I can’t motivate you to train or diet. You have to have the willpower to reach your goals, and with my experience and knowledge, I will help to reach them in the easiest, safest and most effective way possible.</p>

            <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
            <h4>Why should you hire a coach? It’s a very reasonable question. You can absolutely get stronger, leaner and fitter on your own. But coaching has some unique advantages that might make the progress a lot easier.
            </h4>
            <div id="benefits-text">
                <h5>ADVICE</h5>
                <p>Nowadays you can search for anything on the internet, but without a solid foundation of knowledge, it’s incredibly hard to know what is good information.<br><br>

                    How much protein do you need? Is saturated fat bad for you? How many sets should you do? What type of training structure should you follow? Linear periodization? Undulating periodization? Block periodization? It's a nightmare!<br><br>
                    
                    These questions aren’t easy to answer unless you have experience and knowledge, and searching online will give you countless contradictory answers. A good coach can tell you exactly what you need to do and also the reason behind it. You don’t have to constantly be worried about what is legitimate or not.<br><br>
 
                                      
                    </p>
                <div id="advice-imagebox">
                    <img src="images/Adviceimage.jpg" id="advice-image"></div>
                <p>  While you can learn this on your own, why would you? These are some of the fitness books I have read over the years. This isn't even all of them, not to mention ebooks and journal articles. You can also read them and understand training and nutrition a lot better, but you will spend hundreds or thousands of hours doing so.<br><br>
                    
                    I could have built this website myself, but it would likewise require many hours of learning and trial and error. Instead, I paid a webdesigner to do it. It is much easier and saves me a lot of time and effort. I don't care about being a webdesigning expert, just like most people don't care about becoming a fitness expert. They just want to achieve their fitness goals, very much just like I wanted a website.<br><br>
                    </p>

                <h5>ACCOUNTABILITY</h5>
                <p>Most people fail because they simply stop doing what’s necessary to produce the result they want, even if they know what they should do.<br><br>

                    When you’re doing something on your own, it’s hard to keep yourself accountable. If you have someone watching for you, you now feel responsible for your own actions.<br><br> 
                    You know someone cares about your progress and wants you to succeed, so you feel bad if you disappoint them. Accountability makes sure you stick to the plan and don’t sabotage yourself.
                    </p>
                
                    <h5>OBJECTIVITY</h5>
                    <p>It’s hard to be objective about your training and dieting. This is one of the reasons why it’s common for coaches to also get coached by someone else. Even with all the knowledge and experience in the world, it’s impossible to be objective about your own progress.<br><br>

                        People often start over-analyzing everything, worrying about every little detail. If their weight isn’t going as it’s supposed to, they’re very inclined to change calories too soon, or if they miss a rep in their training, they immediately think something is wrong with their programming.<br><br>
                        
                        They do this because they lack objectivity, they can’t look at themselves without their own biases. This is where a coach comes in: they can analyse your progress with detachment, avoiding unnecessary changes that can harm your long-term progress.
                        </p>

            <h4>I follow an approach to my coaching based on evidence-based practice (EBP), which optimizes decision-making for medical practitioners. Here I adapted it to evidence-based coaching (EBC). </h4>
            <img src="images/chart.png" alt="" id="img-chart">
            <div id="benefits-text2">
                <h6>EBC relies on 3 foundations:</h6>
                <p><b>Research Evidence:</b> Decisions must be based on scientific evidence, and the strength of the evidence should be considered. For example, research has consistently shown that high volume is beneficial for hypertrophy. <br>
<br>
                    <b>Coaching Experience:</b> Practitioner experience is paramount and should be synergistic with research for the best outcomes. For instance, I have noticed that low-intensity deloads are often detrimental to strength in a powerlifting context. Reducing fatigue by relative intensity and volume instead seems to work better in my experience. <br>
<br>                    
                    <b>Client’s Preferences:</b> The client's preferences and values must be taken into account, and the ultimate goal is to help the client reach their own personal goals. While this also applies to training, it’s best seen in nutrition. No matter how good of a plan it is, people aren’t going to follow a diet they don’t like.

  <div id="pricetext"><p>With both the Gold and Silver packages, you get a completely individualized plan to reach your goals. The difference is the amount of contact you have with me.<br><br>

                If you have the gold package, then you can ask me any questions or concerns you may have every day, by either WhatsApp or Messager. We will also have a private Facebook group just for the two of us. This will be used for the weekly check-in with me where you describe how your week went. Ideally, the check-in is done by a 2-4 minute video. The Facebook group is also useful to post progress pictures, lifting videos for technique analysis, or anything else that you want to share.<br><br>
                
                Based on your weekly feedback and the data you logged during the week, I will adjust your plan as needed, and a new week will automatically show up in your client spreadsheet. At the end of the month, I am available for a 1on1 video call if you want to discuss any aspect of your diet or training more in-depth.<br><br>
                
                With the silver package, the contact is more limited. You also have a scheduled check-in, but it's monthly instead of weekly. The plan is changed monthly rather than weekly, and the contact is done by email.<br><br>
                
                The difference is how much guidance you need. If you struggle with accountability, as most people do, the gold package is preferred. But if you mostly want to get a solid training and diet program to follow, or if your budget is limited, then the silver package might be a better option.</p>

                        The coaching booklet refers to a physical book that all my clients get. I wrote it myself and only my clients have access.  This started as a private page on my website, but it got so big that I figured a book would be more suitable. <br><br>
                        
                        You will have it shipped to your door when you sign up. It includes detailed information about training and nutrition that is specific to how I do my client’s programming and nutrition. It also has many nutrition tips on how to make dieting easier, such as how to structure meal prepping, how to eat out while dieting, specific recipes, and more.

            <h6>Getting your plan is an easy process and just takes a few days. It has roughly 4 steps:</h6>
            <p>1. By clicking the contact section of this website you will be able to reach me by email. You can give a very brief introduction about yourself and mention the plan you’re interested in. Nothing in detail is required since that will come later.<br><br>

                2. I will answer your email in 24 hours, and I will send you a questionnaire for you to fill. This is where you will give me all your information. Everything about your goals, your history, your preferences, etc.<br><br>
                
                3. After you have filled the questionnaire and I have reviewed it, we can book a free video call in order to discuss any concerns you may have. I typically have availability to book it for the very next day, so that you get your plan as soon as possible. This call is beneficial but not required, it can also be done by email if you so prefer. <br><br>
                
                4. Following the call I will have all the necessary information, and I will start working on your plan as soon as possible. You will receive it by email in a few days and you can start right away.

                        <h6>CLIENT SPREADSHEET</h6>
                        <p>When you receive the program, you will get a Google Sheets spreadsheet that looks something like this, although the layout and content will vary based on your specific needs, this is just a generic example.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/lPWhR6O 1.png" alt="">

                            <p>Each week is a separate tab and acts as a dashboard where you can see the most important information regarding your training and nutrition. This is just the practical end of things of what you need on a daily basis. More detailed information is contained in the book provided. <br><br>
                            
                            The spreadsheet doesn’t only tell you what to do but also serves as a place where you can log all the information required, such as your body weight, nutrition, training, and several kinds of ratings. <br><br>
                            
                            The spreadsheet also contains a separate tab for some statistics. This where some important information about you is tracked, not just of a specific week, but for the entire period you have been working with me. It automatically makes some calculations and charts which are useful to see your progress over time, such as body weight or strength.</p>

                <h6>PACKAGE DIFFERENCES </h6>
                <p>So far of all this applies to both plans that I offer, the gold package and the silver package. The difference is the amount of contact you have with me after this point. <br><br>

                    If you have the gold package, then you can ask me any questions or concerns you may have every day, by either WhatsApp or Messager. We will also have a private Facebook group just for the two of us. This can be used for the weekly check-in with me where you describe how your week went. I prefer that my clients do this by video, but writing is also acceptable. The video is also useful to post progress pictures, lifting videos for technique analysis, or anything else that you want to share. <br><br>
                    
                    Based on your weekly feedback and the data you logged into the spreadsheet, I will adjust your plan as needed, and a new week will automatically show up in your client spreadsheet. At the end of the month, I am available for a 1on1 video call if you want to discuss any aspect of your diet or training more in-depth. <br><br>
                    
                    With the silver package, the contact is more limited. You also have a scheduled check-in, but it's monthly instead of weekly. And instead of making the changes to your plan weekly, they are made in advance for the whole month. <br><br>
                    
                    With both packages, you will get a completely individualized plan that will help you achieve your goals. The difference is how much guidance you need. If you struggle with accountability, the gold package is preferred. If you mostly want to get a solid training and diet program to follow, or if your budget is limited, then the silver package might be a better option for you. </p>
